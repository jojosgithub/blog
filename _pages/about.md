I'm a researcher at the National Research Council of Italy at the "Giulio Natta" Institute of Chemical Sciences and Technologies (Scitec-Cnr).I started to be interested in multivariate statistics techniques applied to data from physic-chemical analysis methods 15 years ago during my  Ph.D. and to apply it to material science ever since. Enthusiast about programming in R and Python in order to write tools for everyday laboratory activities. FOSS advocate. Messy coder. I've written also a book on this topic: "Statistical and Multivariate Analysis in Material Science" that you can find here [amzn.com/B08W8W5WSF](amzn.com/B08W8W5WSF)
